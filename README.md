# Lease-Tenant-Analysis-Using-Excel
Just wrapped up an Excel-based sales analytics and data-cleaning project!

This one combined everything from conditional formatting and sorting to SUMIFs, VLOOKUPs, and structured reporting. I worked through duplicate detection, yearly sales aggregation, tenant lookups, and formatting for financial reporting — all while organizing a large dataset with over 12 months of sales per tenant.

A great reminder of how powerful Excel can be for real-world business operations and financial insights.
